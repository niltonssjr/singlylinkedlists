Test project about singly linked lists

This is a simple project created for study purposes only.

In order to study about linked lists, I created a class to handle it, with various methods we would need if it was implemented in a real project.

The unit tests were made using JEST.

To install the project:

- clone the repository
- run npm install

To run the tests, use:

- npm test
